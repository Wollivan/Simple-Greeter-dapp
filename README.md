# Simple dApp that connects a wallet and runs the Greet function

This is just a very simple dApp that shows how to set provider in state, and allow the user to decline connecting their wallet, but show an option to connect in after declining.
Once connecting, you can then run a function on the Greeter contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Run the following commands to set up:

```
npm i
cd client/
npm i
npm start
```

The Greeter contract is already deployed, this project is not to showcase using hardhat, rather what your projct might look like AFTER you've done that, and shows how to use that contract.
